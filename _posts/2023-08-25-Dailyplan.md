Daily Plan
## Monday: 
get website commited and pushed in order to get the github pages link to work
## Tuesday: 
Got the code for my quiz in python, but it would not show up on my webiste so I had to convert it into html so it shows on webiste. So I kept the orignal python code for the quiz, but I added the quiz in html
## Wednesday: 
Get snake game and game of life to work properly on blogs. Add the meta data on all the plans, hacks, and tangibles in order to get it showing up on the CSP. 
## Thursday: 
Add the table to Js/query, customize it to make it your own 
## Friday:
Clone the student repository once more to get rid of the Csse and Csa tabs on the webiste then transfer all the original data over.
