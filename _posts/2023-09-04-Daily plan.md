## Monday
Nothing done today since it was Labor Day
## Tuesday
Get the rock paper scissors game by working. Computer randomly generates 1 of the 3 options then stores it as a variable. Based on the button you clicked, it will compare your input to the stored variable and say if you won or if you lost.
## Wednesday
Listen to the talk about java and learn the basics. This includes creating a colored box with words inside of it which could be easily changed. After, I created the code where you get to choose the words, the size, and the colors of the words. 
## Thursday
Today I created a Youtube music player. I used the Youtube data Api in order to get the music playing. However, I need to figure out why some of the songs are not playing.
